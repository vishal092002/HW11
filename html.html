    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an
        all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and
        internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate,
        and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:</p>

    <blockquote>&ldquo;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members.
        I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.&rdquo;</blockquote>

    <h2>Our Ticket Packages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Season Package: $95</li>
        <li>Patron Package: $200</li>
